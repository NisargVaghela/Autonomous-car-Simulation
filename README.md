# Autonomous Car Simulation (TensorFlow)

A virtual traffic environment for training autonomous cars using reinforcement learning.The agent learns to navigate dynamic environments with moving obstacles, achieving successful obstacle avoidance.

### Demo:

### Features:

- Designed with TensorFlow for efficient training.
- Utilizes reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., Q-Learning) for autonomous car behavior optimization.
- Simulates dynamic traffic environments with customizable numbers of moving obstacles for obstacle avoidance training.
